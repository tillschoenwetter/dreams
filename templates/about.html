      <p>
        DreamAtlas is a growing map of shared dreams, inviting visitors to contribute personal dream fragments to a collective dreambank. Through algorithmic analysis, individual dreams connect into a visual constellation that reveals shared symbols, themes, and emotions. A repurposed telescope interface guides users through this inner universe, transforming subconscious exploration into a communal experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        DreamAtlas is a web-based platform and participatory artwork that transforms the act of dream-sharing into an exploration of the subconscious as a collective landscape.
